 ## Future Goals
 
 In the future, I want to continue my passion for learning languages. My dream is to travel around the world [teaching English in other countries](https://www.teachaway.com/teach-english-abroad). I'm currently studying Korean and would like to teach in Seoul, South Korea or two years. I am very interested to see how this culture differs from my own, and how to two will clash when I visit.

  Another goal I have would to either be a writer, or an editor at a publishing company. A job where I can spend all day reading sounds like a dream come true. I admire so many authors for their ability to write, and I am able to learn so much through reading their work. Creating a bestselling novel would be the single greatest thing to ever happen to me, and I hope one say I will be able to achieve this.
