## About Me

My name in Katelyn McEnroe. I am 20 years old, and I attend the Univeristy of Missouri. I am in my second year, and I am an English major. In my spare time, I enjoy different hobbies including; reading, writing, learning languages, listening to podcasts, rewatching _Criminal Minds_, and getting coffee with friends. I have two dogs, Sasha and Chewie. When I turned 18, I adopted a kitten who made quick work of showing everyone who really owned the house.

I'm a huge travel enthusiast thanks to my father, a pilot. I will travel any chance I get, even if it's someplace I've already been. Sometimes I wonder if its the traveling I like, or the flying. So far my favorite places I've been are Seattle, Hawaii, and Costa Rica. Both Hawaii and Costa Rica were beautiful with nice weather, huge trees, and flowers I'd never seen before, while Seatlle was the complete opposite. The weather was so gloomy that I felt I had just walked onto a Grey Anatomy set, but even so placed in my top 3 favorite places. I believe that it was due to the constant opportunity for travel that I gained an interest in, not only languages, but other cultures as well. After reading the book _Guests of the Sheik_ by **Elizabeth Warnock Fernea**, I was completely taken aback by the incredible differences between my own culture and another and how the two came together.
